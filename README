The NE Text Editor

The latest source for NE is kept at this FTP site:

ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/wordprocessing/unix/ne/ne-xx.xx.tar.gz

I hope that this version of the program will run without problems on all Unix 
and Unix-like systems. It should just be a matter of typing

./configure
make
make install

NE uses Terminfo features when running in screen mode. It can be configured to 
use the older Termcap system by running

./configure --enable-termcap

NE makes use of the PCRE library for regular expression matching. From release
3.10 it uses PCRE2 (versions 10.xx). PCRE1 (versions 8.xx) is a dead-end as far
as long-term maintenance is concerned. You can, however, revert to using PCRE1
by running

./configure --disable-pcre2

The final NE-specific "configure" option is

./configure --disable-vdiscard

This is provided for use in environments where the VDISCARD flag for terminal 
handling is not defined.
